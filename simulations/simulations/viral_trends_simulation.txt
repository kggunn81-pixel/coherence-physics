CPE²-0101 Simulation: Viral Trends
=================================

Equation:
d²C/dt² = κ(dC/dt) - λ(dC/dt)²

Plain-English Interpretation:
- Coherence (C) grows faster and faster (like a snowball rolling downhill).
- But if it grows TOO fast, damping (λ) slows it down (like friction).
- This explains why some memes/trends "go viral" and then fade.

Example Data (Meme Popularity Over Time):
| Day | Coherence (C) | Growth Rate (dC/dt) | Notes                  |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 0   | 0.1           | 0.05                | Meme posted.           |
| 1   | 0.3           | 0.15                | Shared by 10 people.   |
| 2   | 0.6           | 0.30                | Trending in niche groups. |
| 3   | 0.9           | 0.45                | Peak virality.         |
| 4   | 1.0           | 0.50                | Saturation (everyone who cares has seen it). |
| 5   | 1.0           | 0.20                | Damping kicks in (people get bored). |

Key Insight:
- Viral trends follow an S-curve: slow start → exponential growth → plateau.
- The equation predicts the plateau point (when λ(dC/dt)² > κ(dC/dt)).
