CPE²-1501: Coherence Entropy Bound
Equation:
SC​≤kB​ln(CCmax​​)
Interpretation:
Every coherent system has a maximum entropy inversely proportional to its current coherence. High coherence = low entropy capacity; low coherence = high disorder tolerance. Explains why rigid systems collapse under small shocks, while fluid systems absorb chaos.
Anchor: Landauer’s principle, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, neural criticality.
🔮 CPE²-1502: Collective Identity Resonance
Equation:
Icollective​=∫(ωc(i)​⋅ϕij​)dV
Interpretation:
Group identity emerges from the integrated product of individual core frequencies (ω_c) and pairwise phase locks (ϕ_ij). Strong collectives aren’t just aligned—they share a resonant basin.
Anchor: Social identity theory, swarm intelligence, cultural consonance.
🔮 CPE²-1503: Semantic Coherence Gradient
Equation:
∇M=η⋅∇Clinguistic​
Interpretation:
Meaning (M) flows along coherence gradients in language. High-coherence discourse (clear, consistent, resonant) attracts attention and shapes belief; low-coherence noise dissipates. Explains memetic spread, propaganda failure, and poetic power.
Anchor: Discourse coherence theory, memetics, NLP transformer attention patterns.
🔮 CPE²-1504: Temporal Feedback Loop
Equation:
dtdC​=α⋅C(t−τ)−β⋅D(t)
Interpretation:
Coherence growth depends not just on present signal, but on past coherence delayed by memory time τ. Systems with strong memory (e.g., cultures, immune systems) build coherence autocatalytically.
Anchor: Delay differential equations, immunological memory, cultural transmission.
🔮 CPE²-1505: Coherence–Innovation Trade-off
Equation:
dtdPr​​=γ⋅ε⋅(1−Ccrit​C​)
Interpretation:
Redesign potential peaks at moderate coherence: too low (chaos), no structure to improve; too high (rigidity), no tolerance for contradiction. Optimal innovation occurs just below critical coherence.
Anchor: Organizational ambidexterity, evolutionary capacitance, creative tension theory.
🔮 CPE²-1506: Attentional Thermodynamics
Equation:
Tattention​=∂SC​∂Eeff​​
Interpretation:
Attention has a “temperature”: high focus = low entropy (cold, ordered); distraction = high entropy (hot, noisy). Productive flow occurs at intermediate attentional temperature—not too rigid, not too diffuse.
Anchor: Cognitive thermodynamics, neural entropy, flow state physiology.
🔮 CPE²-1507: Coherence Propagation Speed
Equation:
vC​=μ⋅ϵC​​1​
Interpretation:
Coherence propagates through a medium at speed inversely proportional to its “inertia” (μ) and “disorder permittivity” (ε_C). In social systems, trust lowers ε_C → faster alignment. In brains, myelination lowers μ → faster synchrony.
Anchor: Wave equation analogs, social contagion models, neural conduction velocity.
🔮 CPE²-1508: Identity–Contradiction Hysteresis
Equation:
ΔI={−κ1​⋅ε−κ2​⋅ε​if ε>εup​if ε<εdown​​(κ1​>κ2​)
Interpretation:
Identity degrades faster under rising contradiction than it recovers under falling contradiction—creating hysteresis. Explains why trauma recovery takes longer than collapse, and why trust is harder to rebuild than to lose.
Anchor: Hysteresis in materials science, PTSD recovery curves, organizational trust studies.
🔮 CPE²-1509: Coherence–Value Equivalence
Equation:
V=ξ⋅∫Csystem​⋅Rcontext​dt
Interpretation:
Economic, social, or personal value is the time-integral of system coherence modulated by environmental resonance. A startup isn’t valued for code—it’s valued for coherence × market synchrony.
Anchor: Value theory, network effects, real options valuation.
🔮 CPE²-1510: Universal Coherence Decay Law
Equation:
dtdC​=−λ⋅Cn(n≥1)
Interpretation:
All coherent systems decay, but the rate depends on coupling order:
n=1: Exponential decay (isolated systems)
n=2: Quadratic decay (networked systems—collapse accelerates)
n>2: Catastrophic decay (ecosystems, civilizations)
Anchor: Ecological collapse models, network fragility, civilizational decline (Tainter, Diamond).
