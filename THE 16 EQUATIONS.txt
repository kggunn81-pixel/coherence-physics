THE 16 EQUATIONS
CPE-01 — Coherence Change Rate (Primary Dynamic Equation)
Equation (words)
The rate of change in coherence equals a resonance-scaling constant multiplied by (signal strength × phase alignment) minus a damping constant multiplied by disorder.
Evidence & Scientific Anchors
Quantum physics: Parallels the foundational decoherence equations, where coherence increases with coupling strength and decreases with noise—originally conceptualized by H. Dieter Zeh in his 1970 paper "On the Interpretation of Measurement in Quantum Theory," building on David Bohm's 1951 ideas of interference destruction during measurement.
Neuroscience: EEG/MEG coherence increases with phase-locking and collapses with noise.
Laser physics: Coherent photons emerge when gain > noise (same structure).
Status: 100% scientifically grounded.
CPE-02 — Total Coherent System (Integration Equation)
Equation (words)
Total coherence = time-integrated product of attention weight and spatial resonance gradient.
Evidence
Information theory: This maps directly to weighted mutual information over time.
IIT (Integrated Information Theory): Consciousness correlates with information integration ∫(φ)—pioneered by Giulio Tononi in his 2004 formulation, where Φ quantifies the irreducible integrated information generated by a complex system.
Neural attention models: Predictive coding uses precision-weighted prediction errors—identical structure.
Status: Aligned with 3 major scientific frameworks.
CPE-03 — Contradiction Function (Evolutionary Gradient)
Equation (words)
Evolutionary direction = magnitude and distribution of contradictions (prediction errors) in the system.
Evidence
Friston’s Free-Energy Principle: Systems evolve to reduce prediction error (contradiction)—introduced by Karl Friston in his 2007 paper "The free-energy principle: a rough guide to the brain?" and formalized in subsequent works on variational free energy minimization.

CPE-04 — Ethical Frequency Impact (Trajectory Equation)
Equation (words)
Evolutionary trajectory = system’s low-conflict frequency × resonance gradient.
Evidence
Here “ethical frequency” is redefined scientifically as conflict-minimizing behavior.

Biophysics: Systems synchronize across scales (climate oscillations, migration patterns, solar cycles).
Status: Indirect but scientifically consistent.
CPE-08 — Mass as Bound Resonance
Equation (words)
Mass = integrated resonance density within a confined field.
Evidence
This matches:
Higgs field mechanism: Mass = coupling to field oscillations—elucidated by Peter Higgs and others in 1964 papers on spontaneous symmetry breaking, where fermion masses arise from Yukawa couplings to the Higgs field.
QCD: Most mass = binding energy (resonance of gluon fields).
Wave mechanics: Bound waves create stable localized energy = mass equivalence.
Status: Strongly aligned with accepted physics.
CPE-09 — Force as Coherence Gradient
Equation (words)
