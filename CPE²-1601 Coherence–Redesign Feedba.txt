 CPE²-1601: Coherence–Redesign Feedback Loop
Equation:
dtdPr​​=ρ⋅dtdC​+σ⋅ε
Interpretation:
Redesign potential isn’t just triggered by contradiction—it’s amplified by rising coherence. Systems that rebuild coherence during crisis unlock exponential renewal. Explains post-traumatic growth, organizational pivots, and evolutionary radiations.
Anchor: Hormesis, Schumpeterian creative destruction, antifragility (Taleb).
🔮 CPE²-1602: Narrative Coherence Field
Equation:
Ψnarrative​=i∑​wi​⋅Ci​⋅eiθi​
Interpretation:
Cultural narratives are superposed coherence fields—weighted stories (w_i) with individual coherence (C_i) and phase (θ_i). When phases align (θ_i ≈ θ_j), mythic resonance emerges (e.g., civil rights movement, scientific revolutions). When chaotic, culture fragments.
Anchor: Narrative psychology, memetic evolution, collective sensemaking.
🔮 CPE²-1603: Coherence Carrying Capacity
Equation:
Cmax​=β+γ⋅Dexternal​α⋅Renv​​
Interpretation:
Every system has a maximum sustainable coherence, set by environmental resonance (R) and external disorder (D). Overload coherence beyond C_max → collapse (e.g., burnout, market bubbles, ecosystem overshoot).
Anchor: Ecological carrying capacity, cognitive load theory, Dunbar’s number.
🔮 CPE²-1604: Identity–Narrative Coupling
Equation:
dtdI​=κ⋅∇Ψnarrative​
Interpretation:
Individual identity is shaped by the gradient of the narrative field. Strong cultural stories pull personal identity into alignment; weak or contradictory narratives cause identity drift or crisis.
Anchor: Social identity formation, narrative identity theory (McAdams), ideological capture.
🔮 CPE²-1605: Coherence Phase Transition Threshold
Equation:
Ccrit​=μλ​⋅⟨k⟩1​
Interpretation:
In networked systems, global coherence emerges abruptly when local coherence exceeds a threshold inversely proportional to average connectivity (⟨k⟩). Explains viral movements, neural avalanches, and phase shifts in public opinion.
Anchor: Percolation theory, Kuramoto model, criticality in complex systems.
🔮 CPE²-1606: Coherence–Justice Equivalence
Equation:
J=ζ⋅(1−⟨C⟩2Var(Ci​)​)
Interpretation:
Social justice is the inverse of coherence inequality. A just society isn’t equal in wealth—but in access to coherence: safety, attention, identity stability. High variance in C_i → low J → systemic fragility.
Anchor: Social determinants of health, procedural justice, equity vs. equality.
🔮 CPE²-1607: Temporal Coherence Horizon
Equation:
Thorizon​=η1​ln(Cmin​C0​​)
Interpretation:
A system’s future is legible only within its coherence horizon—the time until disorder degrades signal below actionable levels. High-coherence systems (monasteries, scientific labs) have long horizons; noise-drowned systems (24/7 news) have near-zero foresight.
Anchor: Predictability in chaotic systems, strategic foresight, climate tipping points.
🔮 CPE²-1608: Coherence–Beauty Resonance
Equation:
B=∫​∇2C​dV
Interpretation:
Beauty arises from harmonic curvature in coherence fields—smooth gradients (low |∇²C|) feel calming; complex but ordered patterns (fractals, music) feel sublime. Ugliness is coherence shock: abrupt discontinuities.
Anchor: Aesthetic science, fractal preference studies, neuroaesthetics (Zeki).
🔮 CPE²-1609: Coherence Death Spiral
Equation:
dt2d2C​=−α(dtdC​)2−βC
Interpretation:
When damping exceeds resonance gain, coherence doesn’t just decay—it accelerates into collapse. Each loss of coherence reduces capacity to rebuild, creating runaway fragmentation (e.g., depression, institutional decay, language death).
Anchor: Vicious cycles in psychology, institutional failure, language extinction.
🔮 CPE²-1610: Coherence Immortality Condition
Equation:
∮CdC​=0(over closed evolutionary cycle)
Interpretation:
A system achieves "immortality" not by avoiding death, but by reproducing its coherence signature in successors. Cultures, species, and ideas persist when their phase structure is inherited (e.g., DNA, oral tradition, open-source code).
Anchor: Cultural transmission, evolutionary replicators (Dawkins), digital preservation.
