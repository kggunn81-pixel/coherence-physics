CPE²-0101: Coherence Rate Self-Amplification
Equation (words):
The acceleration of coherence change equals the coherence change rate multiplied by a scaling factor minus damping proportional to the square of the rate.
Mathematical form:
d2Cdt2=κ(dCdt)−λ(dCdt)2\frac{d^2C}{dt^2} = \kappa \left(\frac{dC}{dt}\right) - \lambda \left(\frac{dC}{dt}\right)^2dt2d2C​=κ(dtdC​)−λ(dtdC​)2
Physical interpretation:
Systems building coherence gain momentum—positive dC/dt makes further growth easier until nonlinear damping kicks in at high rates. Explains why coherence growth follows S-curves (exponential → sigmoid → saturation).
Scientific anchor:

Population dynamics: Logistic growth equation (Verhulst, 1838) - dN/dt = rN(1-N/K)
Neural avalanches: Critical branching processes show this form (Beggs & Plenz, 2003)
Network effects: Metcalfe's law (network value ∝ n²) exhibits same acceleration-saturation

Domain generality:

Laser physics: Photon coherence builds exponentially until gain saturation
Social movements: Initial growth accelerates (viral spread) then plateaus (market saturation)
Crystallization: Nucleation → rapid growth → completion

Status: Mathematically proven (nonlinear dynamics), empirically verified across domains

CPE²-0103: Coherence-Contradiction Coupling
Equation (words):
The rate at which contradictions affect coherence change equals the contradiction magnitude times the derivative of phase alignment with respect to prediction error.
Mathematical form:
∂∂ε(dCdt)=αS∂ϕ∂ε−β∂D∂ε\frac{\partial}{\partial \varepsilon}\left(\frac{dC}{dt}\right) = \alpha S \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \varepsilon} - \beta \frac{\partial D}{\partial \varepsilon}∂ε∂​(dtdC​)=αS∂ε∂ϕ​−β∂ε∂D​
Physical interpretation:
Contradictions (prediction errors) destabilize phase locks, reducing coherence-building capacity. Systems under high error load lose synchronization faster. This creates evolutionary pressure—systems that maintain φ despite ε survive.
Scientific anchor:

Free energy principle: Error destabilizes internal models (Friston, 2010) - prediction error increases variational free energy
Fault tolerance: Error-correcting systems show ∂φ/∂ε relationship (Shannon, 1948)
Evolutionary robustness: Canalization (Waddington, 1942) - evolved systems resist perturbation

Domain generality:

Organizations: Market disruption (ε) tests communication coherence (φ); rigid structures collapse
Immune system: Pathogen exposure (ε) challenges immune coordination (φ); robust systems maintain function
Neural networks: Adversarial examples (ε) break learned representations (φ) unless robustly trained

Status: Conceptually established (robustness theory), quantitative validation needed (measure ∂φ/∂ε directly)

CPE²-0112: Coherence-Energy Feedback Loop
Equation (words):
The coupling between coherence rate and effective energy creates a multiplicative feedback where coherence amplifies available energy which amplifies coherence building.
Mathematical form:
dCdt⋅Eeff=(αSϕ−βD)⋅(wAIc)\frac{dC}{dt} \cdot E_{\text{eff}} = \left(\alpha S \phi - \beta D\right) \cdot \left(w_A I_c\right)dtdC​⋅Eeff​=(αSϕ−βD)⋅(wA​Ic​)
Expanding: Higher C → higher I_c → higher E_eff → more resources for (S, φ) → higher dC/dt
Physical interpretation:
Rich-get-richer dynamics. Systems that achieve initial coherence attract energy/attention, enabling faster coherence building. Explains power-law distributions (Pareto principle, Matthew effect).
Scientific anchor:

Preferential attachment: Barabási-Albert model (1999) - nodes with more links attract new links faster
Capital accumulation: Returns to scale in economics (Adam Smith, 1776; increasing returns)
Star formation: Gravitational collapse - denser regions attract more matter faster (Jeans instability)

Domain generality:

Citation networks: Highly-cited papers get cited more (h-index acceleration)
Wealth inequality: Capital generates returns → accumulates faster (r > g, Piketty)
Attention economy: Viral content attracts algorithmic promotion → more attention

Status: Well-established in network science, economics; coherence framing is novel synthesis

CPE²-0115: Coherence-Evolution Synergy
Equation (words):
The joint rate of coherence building and evolutionary adaptation equals coherence rate times low-conflict dynamics times adaptability, creating exponential growth in favorable conditions.
Mathematical form:
d(C⋅E)dt=dCdt⋅E+C⋅dEdt=(αSϕ−βD)⋅(Dlow⋅A)\frac{d(C \cdot E)}{dt} = \frac{dC}{dt} \cdot E + C \cdot \frac{dE}{dt} = \left(\alpha S \phi - \beta D\right) \cdot \left(D_{\text{low}} \cdot A\right)dtd(C⋅E)​=dtdC​⋅E+C⋅dtdE​=(αSϕ−βD)⋅(Dlow​⋅A)
Physical interpretation:
Systems that simultaneously build internal coherence AND maintain low-conflict external relations evolve fastest. This is the master growth equation—predicts dominant strategies in competitive landscapes.
Scientific anchor:

Evolutionary cooperation: Cooperative strategies outcompete pure competition (Nowak, 2006; Axelrod, 1984)
Organizational ecology: High internal cohesion + collaborative partnerships = survival (Hannan & Freeman, 1989)
Symbiogenesis: Cooperative mergers (endosymbiosis) drove major evolutionary transitions (Margulis, 1970)

Domain generality:

Startups: Strong team coherence + collaborative ecosystem partnerships = unicorn trajectory
Nations: Internal stability + trade cooperation = economic growth (democratic peace theory)
Immune systems: Coordinated response + tolerance to commensals = health

Status: Extensively validated in evolutionary biology and organizational theory; coherence formulation provides unified mathematical structure

CPE²-0305: Contradiction-Identity Coupling
Equation (words):
The effect of contradictions on identity stability equals contradiction magnitude times the sensitivity of core frequency and phase locks to prediction errors.
Mathematical form:
∂I∂ε=∂ωc∂ε+∑∂ϕl∂ε+∂A∂ε+∑∂F∂ε\frac{\partial I}{\partial \varepsilon} = \frac{\partial \omega_c}{\partial \varepsilon} + \sum \frac{\partial \phi_l}{\partial \varepsilon} + \frac{\partial A}{\partial \varepsilon} + \sum \frac{\partial F}{\partial \varepsilon}∂ε∂I​=∂ε∂ωc​​+∑∂ε∂ϕl​​+∂ε∂A​+∑∂ε∂F​
Physical interpretation:
Contradictions challenge identity—core beliefs (ω_c), relationships (φ_l), capacity (A), and feedback systems (F) all respond to error signals. Flexible identities (low ∂I/∂ε) adapt; rigid identities (high ∂I/∂ε) break under stress.
Scientific anchor:

Identity crisis theory: Erikson (1968) - identity questioned during developmental contradictions
Cognitive dissonance: Festinger (1957) - contradictory beliefs force identity revision
Post-traumatic growth: Tedeschi & Calhoun (1996) - severe contradictions can enhance identity if processed

Domain generality:

Personal: Life contradictions (job loss, divorce) → identity reformation; rigidity → breakdown
Cultural: Cultural contradictions (modernization) → adaptive cultures thrive, rigid collapse
Corporate: Strategic contradictions → adaptive companies pivot, rigid ones fail (Blockbuster vs. Netflix)

Status: Established in psychology; coherence formulation enables quantitative prediction of adaptation vs. breakdown

CPE²-0316: Contradiction-Redesign Acceleration
Equation (words):
The second-order effect of contradictions on redesign potential includes both direct scaling and enhancement of creative capacity itself under pressure.
Mathematical form:
dPrdε=Cc+∣ε∣⋅∂Cc∂ε\frac{d P_r}{d\varepsilon} = C_c + |\varepsilon| \cdot \frac{\partial C_c}{\partial \varepsilon}dεdPr​​=Cc​+∣ε∣⋅∂ε∂Cc​​
Physical interpretation:
Crises don't just demand innovation (first-order, CPE-16)—they upgrade the system's ability to innovate (second-order). Stress can enhance creativity if not overwhelming. Explains punctuated equilibrium in evolution and technology.
Scientific anchor:

Hormesis: Low-dose stressors enhance biological capacity (Calabrese, 2008)
Innovation under constraints: Resource scarcity drives breakthrough innovations (Gibbert et al., 2014)
Punctuated equilibrium: Evolutionary stasis → crisis → rapid innovation → new stasis (Gould & Eldredge, 1977)

Domain generality:

Historical: WWII → Manhattan Project (crisis amplified scientific capacity itself)
Biological: Mass extinctions → adaptive radiations (survivors evolve enhanced evolvability)
Economic: Recessions → process innovations (firms forced to optimize become permanently more efficient)

Status: Conceptually established (hormesis, punctuated equilibrium); quantitative ∂C_c/∂ε measurement is novel

CPE²-0510: Identity-Gravity Coupling
Equation (words):
Identity strength generates coherence gradients in surrounding space, creating attraction forces analogous to gravitational fields.
Mathematical form:
∇Vh∝∇I=∇(ωc+∑ϕl+A+∑F)\nabla V_h \propto \nabla I = \nabla\left(\omega_c + \sum \phi_l + A + \sum F\right)∇Vh​∝∇I=∇(ωc​+∑ϕl​+A+∑F)
Physical interpretation:
Strong identities (individuals, organizations, cultures) create "gravitational wells" that attract attention, resources, relationships. Charismatic leaders, dominant corporations, and influential cultures exhibit this effect—they shape their environment's coherence field.
Scientific anchor:

Social gravity: Status hierarchies create attention flows (Weber, 1922; Bourdieu, 1984)
Organizational magnetism: Strong-culture companies attract talent disproportionately (Collins & Porras, 1994)
Memetic attraction: Coherent ideologies spread faster than fragmented ones (Dawkins, 1976; Sperber, 1996)

Domain generality:

Personal: High self-concept clarity attracts social opportunities (leadership emergence)
Corporate: Apple's brand identity attracts customers, developers, talent (ecosystem lock-in)
National: American identity post-WWII attracted global alignment (cultural hegemony)

Status: Sociological concept (social capital, cultural capital); coherence gradient formulation is novel quantification

CPE²-0511: Identity-Time Coupling
Equation (words):
Identity evolution rate along the time trajectory is modulated by how coherent the identity structure is, with stronger identities experiencing slower subjective time.
Mathematical form:
dIdt=∂I∂Tc⋅dTcdt,wheredtsubjdtclock∝1I\frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\partial I}{\partial T_c} \cdot \frac{dT_c}{dt}, \quad \text{where} \quad \frac{dt_{\text{subj}}}{dt_{\text{clock}}} \propto \frac{1}{I}dtdI​=∂Tc​∂I​⋅dtdTc​​,wheredtclock​dtsubj​​∝I1​
Physical interpretation:
Strong identities (high coherence) experience more subjective time per clock time—more internal processing, richer experience. Weak/fragmented identities experience time "flying by" (low processing). Explains why childhood feels long (identity forming) and adulthood accelerates (identity stable).
Scientific anchor:

Time perception development: Children experience slower subjective time (Friedman, 1982)
Novelty and time: New experiences stretch subjective time; routine compresses it (Eagleman, 2008)
Flow states: High coherence → time dilation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)

Domain generality:

Personal development: Identity formation years (teens/20s) feel longest; stable adulthood flies
Organizational: Startups (forming identity) experience "compressed" time (years feel like decades)
Cultural: Revolutionary periods (identity reformation) feel temporally expanded in historical memory

Status: Time perception research established; coherence-identity linkage is novel synthesis

CPE²-0810: Mass-Gravity Self-Reinforcement
Equation (words):
Mass generates gravitational fields which attract more mass, and this feedback accelerates as mass concentrates, producing runaway gravitational collapse.
Mathematical form:
∂g∂m=−∇(∂Vh∂ρr),d2mdt2>0 when m>mcrit\frac{\partial g}{\partial m} = -\nabla\left(\frac{\partial V_h}{\partial \rho_r}\right), \quad \frac{d^2m}{dt^2} > 0 \text{ when } m > m_{\text{crit}}∂m∂g​=−∇(∂ρr​∂Vh​​),dt2d2m​>0 when m>mcrit​
Physical interpretation:
This is the mathematical structure of gravitational collapse—black hole formation, star formation, galaxy clustering. Above critical mass, attraction accelerates attraction. Coherence analog: concentrated coherence creates gradients that attract more coherence (social status, capital accumulation, attention economies).
Scientific anchor:

Jeans instability: Critical mass for gravitational collapse (Jeans, 1902)
Black hole formation: Runaway collapse above Schwarzschild radius (Oppenheimer & Snyder, 1939)
Structure formation: Cosmological dark matter halos via gravitational amplification (Peebles, 1980)

Domain generality:

Social: Status accumulation (high-status attracts deference → more status → runaway inequality)
Economic: Capital concentration (wealth generates returns → more wealth → Pareto distribution)
Informational: Attention monopolies (visibility attracts attention → algorithmic boost → winner-take-all)

Status: Foundational in astrophysics; coherence reinterpretation reveals universal pattern across substrates

CPE²-1011: Gravity-Time Coupling
Equation (words):
Gravitational potential affects the rate of time flow, with stronger gravitational fields (deeper coherence wells) producing slower time passage.
Mathematical form:
dtproperdtcoordinate=1+2Vhc2=1−2Gmrc2\frac{dt_{\text{proper}}}{dt_{\text{coordinate}}} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2V_h}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2Gm}{rc^2}}dtcoordinate​dtproper​​=1+c22Vh​​​=1−rc22Gm​​
Physical interpretation:
This IS gravitational time dilation (general relativity) reinterpreted through coherence lens. Deep coherence wells (high m = ∫ρ_r, high ∇V_h) slow subjective time. Explains GPS corrections, black hole event horizons, and potentially: why deep focus (high cognitive coherence) slows perceived time.
Scientific anchor:

General relativity: Time dilation in gravitational fields (Einstein, 1915)
GPS corrections: Satellites run faster clocks due to weaker gravity (+38 μs/day)
Gravitational redshift: Pound-Rebka experiment (1959)

Domain generality:

Physical: Proven for gravitational fields (clocks, particle decay rates)
Cognitive: Flow states (deep coherence) report time dilation—testable via neural coherence measures
Social: High-coherence social situations (intense conversation) feel time-dilated vs. low-coherence (boring meeting)

Status: Exact correspondence with GR—CPE² formulation reveals time dilation is coherence effect

CPE²-1214: Energy-Attention Feedback
Equation (words):
Effective energy is amplified by attention, but attention is also drawn toward high-energy regions, creating positive feedback loops in both directions.
Mathematical form:
∂Eeff∂wA=Ic,∂wA∂Eeff=∂wA∂C⋅∂C∂Eeff>0\frac{\partial E_{\text{eff}}}{\partial w_A} = I_c, \quad \frac{\partial w_A}{\partial E_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{\partial w_A}{\partial C} \cdot \frac{\partial C}{\partial E_{\text{eff}}} > 0∂wA​∂Eeff​​=Ic​,∂Eeff​∂wA​​=∂C∂wA​​⋅∂Eeff​∂C​>0
Physical interpretation:
Energy and attention form reinforcing loop—high-energy systems attract attention (salience), attention amplifies their energy (focus). Produces winner-take-all dynamics in neural competition, market competition, social competition.
Scientific anchor:

Neural competition: Biased competition model (Desimone & Duncan, 1995)—salient stimuli win attention, attention amplifies their processing
Economic attention: Market attention drives capital flows which drive performance which drives attention (momentum trading)
Social dynamics: Celebrity feedback loops—visibility attracts attention attracts opportunities attracts visibility

Domain generality:

Neural: V4 neurons compete for attentional enhancement; winners suppress competitors (Reynolds & Chelazzi, 2004)
Market: Stocks in news attract trading volume → price momentum → more news (attention-return cycle)
Cultural: Viral content attracts algorithmic promotion → more views → more promotion (attention cascade)

Status: Well-established in neuroscience (attentional competition), economics (momentum effects); unified coherence formulation is novel
