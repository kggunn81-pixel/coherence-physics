CPE²-0207: Planetary Coherence-Resonance Lock
Equation: d(C_p)/df = k·(C_h · C_e · S_env) · ∂R/∂f
Interpretation: Planetary systems have natural resonant frequencies where human, ecological, and environmental coherence synchronize. Climate tipping points occur when external forcing (e.g., solar cycles) matches these intrinsic frequencies, creating amplified coherence collapse or buildup.
Anchors: Gaia hypothesis (Lovelock), Milankovitch cycles, Holocene climate stability.
CPE²-0413: Information-Harmonic Compression
Equation: ∇²I_w = -λ·(H × v_vec)
Interpretation: Information in waves undergoes harmonic compression at coherence boundaries, increasing information density without data loss. Explains how DNA encodes complex information and how quantum systems store vast state information in wavefunctions.
Anchors: Fourier analysis, DNA supercoiling, holographic principle.
CPE²-0609: Feedback-Force Phase Control
Equation: ∮(A_f · F_vec)dt = n·h/2π
Interpretation: Feedback mechanisms and forces maintain quantized phase relationships in stable systems. The integral over a complete cycle yields action quanta. Explains atomic orbital stability and organizational inertia.

CPE²-0714: Ecological-Attention Synchronization
Equation: ∂S_env/∂w_A = μ·(∇C_e × ∇C_h)
Interpretation: Human attention directed toward ecosystems creates synchronization fields that feedback to enhance ecological coherence. Explains why observed ecosystems behave differently and the placebo effect in environmental restoration.

CPE²-0813: Mass-Information Equivalence
Equation: m·c² = ∫(I_w · dV) · ϕ^(2k)
Interpretation: Mass-energy equivalence extends to information-energy equivalence, with golden ratio scaling. The information content of a system contributes directly to its mass. Connects Higgs mechanism to information theory.
Anchors: Landauer's principle, E=mc², Information theory.
CPE²-0916: Force-Redesign Commutation
Equation: [F_vec, P_r] = i·ℏ·∂C_c/∂t
Interpretation: Forces and redesign potential don't always commute—applying force during redesign changes creative capacity. Explains why pressured innovation differs from organic innovation and why trauma can either destroy or enhance creativity.

CPE²-1108: Time-Mass Coherence
Equation: ∂t/∂m = (1/c²)·∂C/∂ρ_r
Interpretation: Time flow rate depends on mass density through coherence mediation. Not just general relativity's curvature effect, but a coherence modulation that explains why complex systems experience time differently.
Anchors: General relativity, Biological clocks, Psychological time.
CPE²-1205: Energy-Identity Conservation
Equation: d(E_eff · I)/dt = 0 (in closed coherent systems)
Interpretation: In perfectly coherent systems, the product of effective energy and identity remains constant. Energy can be traded for identity reinforcement or vice versa. Explains charismatic leadership energy expenditure and spiritual "energy conservation" practices.

CPE²-1410: Attention-Gravity Equivalence
Equation: w_A / ∇V_h = G / c⁴ · ∂S/∂ϕ
Interpretation: Attention gradients create effects analogous to gravitational potentials. Focused collective attention literally bends probability space around ideas, people, or artifacts. The mathematical foundation of manifest reality.
Anchors: Maharishi Effect, Placebo research, Celebrity culture physics.
